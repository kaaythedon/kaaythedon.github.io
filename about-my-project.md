## About My Project
AI Approaches to classify COVID-19 related PTSD

The objective of our project is to conduct a secondary analysis to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of using machine learning techniques for predicting PTSD symptomatology (as measured by IES-6) among substance users. We hypothesize that Substance use increases PTSD symptomology when compared to non-Substance users. This relationship is mediated by specific variables that can be identified and predicted using Machine Learning techniques. Our research question is, how does Substance use affect PTSD Symptomology in individuals, and which variables must strongly predict high PTSD Symptomology among substance users?
