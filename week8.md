Dear Diary,

Today alone was amusing just because it was time to record for our elevator pitch and we have a lot of bloopers. This week was a little challenging for me because we are doing a lot of Lasso Regression and typing for our paper. On Monday we assigned the roles for the paper and set a timeline for the rest of the paper as well. We were able to begin our first draft and just watch videos about LASSO Regression.
