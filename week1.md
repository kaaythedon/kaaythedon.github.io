During the first week, I met with my research team, which is all lovely ladies :) and Dr. Meeker (Faculty Mentor). It excites me to research with them for the rest of the summer. We were able to do a team bonding activity in which we built a structure out of noodles and a single marshmallow to understand how we all work together and how we can all come together to better each other. There were a lot of workshops for us to attend and sessions with programming information. I know I am going to learn a lot by the end of the program and laugh a lot.
