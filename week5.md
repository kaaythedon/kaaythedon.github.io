Week 5...halfway!!!!

Starting on Monday, we started with data clean-up and watching tutorials, we also practiced on Colab. Our group also started our presentation for the high schoolers stopping by. On Tuesday, we continued with Colab and could practice still to remove and keep the variables we wanted. Just practiced our presentation for Thursday. On Wednesday, once finished our high school presentation we took into consideration what we could put into our mid-summer presentation. Thursday, was presentation day and I enjoyed presenting in front of the students and they asked really good questions. Friday, was chill as well. Got the chance to have a meeting with Dr. Meeker and he told us about our decision tree. Dr. Pandy came and we also had a meeting with her as well, and she was able to give us some pointers and tips on our presentation.
