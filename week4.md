Dear Diary,

Week 4 was the best week so far because for all my black people HAPPY JUNETEENTH!!!! I looked forward to the week because I love that day, it represents us and a good meal. On Monday we met our high school teacher Maya, who teaches at Baltimore City College and is an 11th-grade teacher. On Tuesday, we started searching and watching tutorials for data cleanup and Machine Learning Algorithms. Wednesday was JUNETEENTH duhhhh!!!!! On Thursday, we visited the NASA Goddard Flight Center, and I had a blast! We got to tour and see the different tools and machines they use. We also learned a lot about the world's climate, warming waters, the rise of waters, and even melted ice caps. On Friday, we had an expected visit with Dr. Pandy about our writing workshop, so we got research ready for her as well as still watching tutorials for data analysis and we ended the day by recording our video.

Signing off,
Kayla
