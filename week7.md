This week in the Lab...

I am stressed and tired! But a good tired. I am learning so much but it is a lot because it is all at once. This week was met with a lot of dedication and preparation due to us having a Mid-Summer Symposium. Monday was a lot of literature reading and summarizing. Tuesday, we found more articles to put into the Matrix to insert in our technical paper. Wednesday, was a little nerve-racking just because our group presented first, so it set the tone for everyone else but the nerves rolled right off once we started. Thursday, was a little more intense because we had to have at least seven articles each and summaries with the articles. I also have been asking my mentor a lot of questions and needing a lot more help with summarizing because it is not like reporting a book, these are scientific literature. Friday, today was about the same as yesterday, it was a little more intense due to us coming up with our outline for the paper and assigning our roles. We also had a writing workshop with Dr. Pandey today, and I feel like we didn't get far, so I just ended up asking my grad mentor for help for the rest of the day. I plan to look at next week far more positive and not worrisome or anxious. I do feel like we are making everything more set in stone and everything will work out the way it will.

See you next week :)...
