In Week 2 I enjoyed going to lab every day. Aside from having the pleasure of getting to know my research partners, we all were able to see how well we worked together to find data and discuss hypotheses and research questions. We also had writing workshops and CITI Training, for which I earned both certificates. My group and I ran into a couple of challenges because we came up with two research questions and we had to find two hypotheses and predictions, we were able to narrow it down to one but then our faculty mentor came and made us create a whole new questions which is better because we can receive more data. I learned the difference between Substance Use and Substance Abuse with the impact of stress, depression, and anxiety, and what drugs and alcohol do to worsen. I am excited for the upcoming week to apply ML to our study/research.
