## About My Mentor

Dr. Timothy Meeker is an Assistant Professor of Biology at Morgan State University. His research interest is examining the role of anxiety in attentional mechanisms related to pain in humans, the potential analgesic mechanism of non-invasive brain stimulation (NIB), neural correlates of mechanical pain and hyperalgesia, and the functional connectivity of the Descending Pain Modulatory Network (DPMN). He is also working on two NIH-funded programs at MSU: A Student-Centered, Entrepreneurship Development (ASCEND) and Research Centers for Minority Institutes (RCMI), and investigates the neural mechanisms associated with racial disparities in pain sensitivity in healthy people and patients with neuropathic pain.
