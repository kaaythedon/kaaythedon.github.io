OH EM GEEEEEE the last week of the program and we were stressing but I had a ball!!!! This last week was just a dedication to our statistical analysis findings and getting our presentation together. Our group got to present first and we did great! I was more nervous than the mid-summer but I felt great and did great. I enjoyed looking at everyone's presentation as well and seeing how far along we got by the last 3 weeks, of course, not everyone got their exact outcome but we all did amazing and I am super proud. I am even more proud of my group and how we were able to overcome everything we put our minds to. I am forever grateful for this internship and the community I have built because of it. We are signing off! :)))
