This week on GIT...

Week 3 is one of my favorite weeks because of obviously the field trip lol. Honestly, it was very eventful and super informative starting with the writing workshop and starting the lab with reading about Machine Learning and Data Analytics. In the lab, we were having discussions about the Technical paper which led us to read articles. Dr. Meeker also hosted a quick lab meeting for us to discuss any updates about our hypothesis, and research question, and we wrote out our project summary. Tuesday was more of a study hall day, read and review articles and find and site articles as well of all time. Wednesday, I was absent. Thursday, we went on a really fun field trip to Johns Hopkins Allied Physics Lab. We went around to different researchers while listening to different projects and also met a robot. Finishing the week off we continued reading our articles and had a writing workshop with Dr. Pandry who helped and told us how to annotate and briefly read a research paper. Finished it off by recording our weekly video.
